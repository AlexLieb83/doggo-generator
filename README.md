<strong>How It's Made:</strong>
Tech used: HTML, CSS

This is a web app using the Dog API to display different dogs based on breeds. It was also my introduction to using the drop down selector with an API.

<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>

Building this site was gave me some more practice using APIs. This project allowed me to experiment with how to communicate with an API and display results to the screen for the user.
Also, I learned how to use the fetch API with a drop down selector. I also got to experiment with using gradients in CSS.
